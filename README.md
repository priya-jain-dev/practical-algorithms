# Practical leet-code

- I am not a good programmer and that I know from a while try multiple times to learn how other programmer do it. I was never consistent. 
From last 2-3 years making something around this issue of my is always in mind. 

- I tried leet-code directly, Problem I have is that I don't know basic problem solution. And most oo them are not relatable to my current work.

- I know I love to code. If I solve one small problem and learn something new around it. I am most happiest person at that moment. Nothing else matter to me as learning right now.

## What wil be practical leet-code

- I don't know how much hours or days or weeks ... I will do it. I tried multiple things around it in past but didn't last for long.. Max was 1-2 weeks.

- I learn by doing things. So I will pick leet-code problem find all real life problem ... where people use it. How they use it. 
That's it.

You can build small real-world applications or projects around many of the problems from the list you provided. These projects can help you apply your programming skills to practical scenarios. Here are some project ideas based on the listed problems:

**1. BestTimeToBuyAndSellStock2_122: Stock Portfolio Tracker**
   - Create a simple stock portfolio tracker that allows users to input their stock purchases and sales, and then calculates the total profit.

**2. CombinationSum3_216: Combination Sum Finder**
   - Build an application that takes a target sum and a list of numbers as input and finds all possible combinations of numbers that sum up to the target.

**3. FindAllDuplicatesInAnArray_442: Duplicate File Finder**
   - Create a tool that scans a directory for duplicate files by comparing file contents and lists the duplicate files for removal.

**4. MergeIntervals_56: Calendar Availability Checker**
   - Develop a calendar availability checker that takes a list of appointments (start and end times) and finds the available time slots for scheduling new appointments.

**5. ShortestWordDistance_243: Text Analysis Tool**
   - Build a tool for analyzing text documents. Users can input two words, and the application will find the shortest distance between occurrences of these words in the text.

**6. SpiralMatrix_54: Game Development**
   - Create a simple 2D game using a spiral matrix as the game board. Users can navigate through the matrix while avoiding obstacles or collecting items.

**7. SetMatrixZeroes_73: Image Editor**
   - Design an image editing tool that allows users to load an image, mark certain pixels, and set them to zero, similar to erasing parts of an image.

**8. ProductOfArrayExceptSelf_238: Online Shop Cart**
   - Build a basic online shopping cart application that calculates the total price of items in the cart while excluding one item at a time to see the effect on the total price.

**9. RangeModule_715: Calendar Booking System**
   - Create a calendar booking system where users can schedule appointments, and the system will handle conflicts and manage the availability of time slots.

**10. ThreeSum_15: Expense Splitter**
   - Develop an application for splitting expenses among a group of people. Users can input expenses, and the app will calculate who owes what to whom.

These project ideas use the listed problems as a starting point and expand upon them to create practical applications. Depending on your interests and the specific problem, you can choose one that aligns with your skills and goals. Building such projects is a great way to reinforce your coding abilities and learn more about real-world application development.
