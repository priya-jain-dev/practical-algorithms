# Practical leet-code

- I am not a good programmer and that I know from a while try multiple times to learn how other programmer do it. I was never consistent. 
From last 2-3 years making something around this issue of my is always in mind. 

- I tried leet-code directly, Problem I have is that I don't know basic problem solution. And most oo them are not relatable to my current work.

- I know I love to code. If I solve one small problem and learn something new around it. I am most happiest person at that moment. Nothing else matter to me as learning right now.

## What wil be practical leet-code

- I don't know how much hours or days or weeks ... I will do it. I tried multiple things around it in past but didn't last for long.. Max was 1-2 weeks.

- I learn by doing things. So I will pick leet-code problem find all real life problem ... where people use it. How they use it. 
That's it. 

**All the best PJ**
